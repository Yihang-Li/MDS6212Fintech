ABOUT
ARQUTE Global Animation Studio
The company which produces children animation content in the form of
intellectual property, guaranteed by mass publication based on the
blockchain.
This technology regulates the legal relationship of the producer and the
authors of the animation product. Provides an opportunity to make
decisions in the process of production and realization of the project by way
of a general vote of the token owners.
The studio and its products are intellectual property, guaranteed by mass
publication based on the blockchain.
                                             FOUNDATION OF THE STUDIO
The project was founded in 2011 to unite creative people and produce art
books, filled with illustrations by independent authors.
Today we are making the world’s first global animation studio of a new
generation with independent investors. We gathered a team of people who
worked on successful projects in the animation and film industry.
Modern technologies allow creating high-quality animation products in a
short time, which accelerates the turnover of investments and increases
profit.
SOCIAL PROJECT
The project will unite many independent creative people around the world,
engaged or interested in the production of animation products.
Everyone can become a part of our team and together with us make
successful projects. The management of the studio will be carried out by a
joint vote of all participants, where any of the votes can be decisive in
making important decisions.
                                                         BUSINESS FOR ALL
Thanks to modern technologies, it’s easy to get a share of ARQUTE G.A.S
and become its co-owners. You just need to get Ethereum purse online,
refill it and make an AGAS token purchase.
The address of the Ethereum wallet is the identifier of the owner of the
token and the project participant. All interactions with participants will be
made automatically through the Smart-Contract.
                                                                              03


DEVELOPMENT PLAN
STUDIO OF NEW GENERATION
Products, which will be produced by the studio, meet modern standards of
quality and technology.
The development will be implemented on a computer 3D engine Unreal
Engine 4 with support for AR (Additional Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality).
We add interactivity - some details of the story and style of narration will
depend on the chosen character.
                                       WHAT WILL CREATE THE STUDIO?
ARQUTE G.A.S will specialize in creating animated series about different
characters         united        by        a         common            world.
The plot is based on the science forbidden in physics about the
luminiferous ether - the all-pervasive medium, vibrations that manifest
themselves in the form of electromagnetic waves.
Under different circumstances, heroes under the influence of ether receive
supernormal powers, through which they struggle with internal and external
enemies.
                                                                              04

                                                                                  06


INITIAL COIN OFFERING
DISTRIBUTION OF TOKEN
All AGAS tokens issued are part of the ARQUTE G.A.S. By purchasing
studio tokens, you become a co-owner of a multi-million dollar business.
Each co-owner has the right to profit and participate in the management of
the business. According to ICO results, each partner will receive a part of
ARQUTE G.A.S profit according to his contribution.
                                                     DISTRIBUTION OF PROFIT
ARQUTE G.A.S will pay 80% of net profit to holders of AGAS tokens at the
end of each calendar month. Another 15% of net profit will be channeled to
the reserve fund, from which funds will be allocated for the development of
existing projects and the creation of new ones. The remaining 5% of net
profit will be sent to the reserve fund, from which the cost of maintaining
the entire structure of ARQUTE G.A.S will be paid.
MANAGEMENT OF STUDIO
ARQUTE G.A.S is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and its
owners are holders of AGAS token. The structure of ARQUTE G.A.S
consists of different organizations that carry out the tasks of creating,
promoting and monetizing products. The executive body is the
administration, which manages the studio on behalf of the holders of the
tokens. Decisions on important issues of the studio are made by voting
among the holders of the tokens.
                                                    TERMS OF PARTICIPATION
Sales of AGAS tokens occur by crediting payment to the Smart-Contract
purse, in return, tokens are sent to the sender’s account. Income belonging
to holders is distributed in equal shares and paid according to the actual
number of tokens issued by transfers to purses for their holders.
BARGAINING
At each stage of primary emissions, a limited number of tokens is issued.
When developing the limit is exceeded, it is frozen until the next stage
begins. If the volume of tokens allocated to the stage has not been sold
completely, it goes to the next stage and increases the volume of tokens in
it. The sale of tokens is carried out until the entire volume is released
(10,000,000), and is not time-limited.
                                                                            07
